# Miniproject
A simple Student Management System built using Java (MVC Architecture) and MySQL Database. This console-based application allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records. The project demonstrates clean separation of concerns using the Model-View-Controller design pattern and integrates database operations using JDBC.
